# Online Azure IIS log analyzer.

A quick tool to analyze the IIS web server access logs from Azure. Just copy and paste the log, and get some instant stats.

To deploy, download the code and run:

```js
npm run build
```

After that, copy the files from the `dist` folder to your server. 

No backend required, but the files won't work locally due to Vue.js being used.
